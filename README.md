# PumpTracker Lite  with more tests
 
A modern, responsive production management system for tracking pump manufacturing orders through their complete lifecycle. Built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Recharts for data visualization.

## 🎯 Overview

PumpTracker Lite is a lightweight yet powerful web application designed to help manufacturing teams manage pump production orders efficiently. It provides real-time visibility into production status, KPI tracking, and intuitive drag-and-drop Kanban board management.

## ✨ Features

### Dashboard View
- **KPI Strip**: Real-time metrics including average build time, shop efficiency, on-time orders, and late orders
- **Workload Distribution**: Donut charts showing workload breakdown by customer and pump model
- **Build Time Trend**: Area chart tracking average build times over the past 12 weeks
- **Value Breakdown**: Pie charts displaying order value distribution by customer and model
- **Order Details Table**: Comprehensive sortable table with all pump order information

### Kanban Board View
- **8-Stage Production Pipeline**: UNSCHEDULED → NOT STARTED → FABRICATION → POWDER COAT → ASSEMBLY → TESTING → SHIPPING → CLOSED
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Move pumps between stages with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality
- **Sorting Controls**: Inline “Sort by” selector (Priority, Model, Customer, PO, Last Update) instantly reorders every stage
- **WIP Limit Management**: Per-stage caps displayed as `count / limit`, with inline editor to adjust limits without leaving the board
- **Smart Card Display**: Each pump card shows essential information including:
  - Model and Serial Number
  - PO Number and Customer
  - Order Value
  - Scheduled End Date
  - Priority Badge (Low, Normal, High, Rush, Urgent)
  - Color-Coded Priority Indicators
- **Capacity Signals**: Stage headers glow when limits are exceeded and display rolling average dwell time for active work-in-progress

### Scheduling View
- **Unscheduled Queue**: Sidebar showing all pumps in "UNSCHEDULED" stage ready for scheduling
- **Drag-and-Drop Calendar**: Intuitive 4-week calendar grid where pumps can be dropped to assign dates
- **Automatic Stage Progression**: When a pump is scheduled, it automatically moves from "UNSCHEDULED" to "NOT STARTED"
- **Smart Scheduling**: Uses model-specific lead times to calculate optimal start and end dates
- **Calendar Event Display**: Scheduled pumps appear as color-coded events on the calendar with stage metadata
- **Empty State Management**: Helpful messaging when all pumps are scheduled with navigation to upcoming work

### Filtering & Search
- **Multi-Criteria Filtering**: Filter by PO, Customer, Model, Priority, and Stage
- **Full-Text Search**: Search across all pump data
- **Quick Clear**: Reset all filters with one click

### Data Management
- **Add PO Modal**: Create new purchase orders with multi-line item support
- **Bulk CSV Import**: Upload pump data from CSV files
- **Local Storage**: Automatic data persistence in browser
- **WIP Limit Editor**: Adjustable caps stored in local persistence so each team can tune throughput targets on the fly
- **Mock Data**: Pre-populated with 80 realistic pump orders for demonstration

## 📊 Key Metrics Explained

### Average Build Time
The mean number of days between order creation and completion for all closed orders.

### Shop Efficiency
The percentage of orders completed on or before their scheduled end date.

### On-Time Orders

## 📈 Data Visualization

The application uses Recharts for interactive charts including:

- Donut Charts: Workload and value distribution
- Area Chart: Build time trends over time
- Pie Charts: Detailed value breakdowns

All charts are responsive and include tooltips, legends, and custom styling.

## ♿ Accessibility

The application follows WCAG 2.1 guidelines:
- Semantic HTML structure
