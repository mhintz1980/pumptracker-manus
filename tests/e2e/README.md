## Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Playwright browsers installed

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npm run test:e2e:install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests in headless mode
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with visible browser
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Run tests with Playwright Test UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug

# Generate new tests with codegen
npm run test:e2e:codegen

# View test reports
npm run test:e2e:report
```

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/e2e/scheduling.spec.ts

# Run tests with specific pattern
npx playwright test --grep "drag and drop"

# Run tests in specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

## Test Architecture

### Test Structure

```

### Key Components

#### SchedulingPageHelper (`helpers/test-utils.ts`)

Utility class providing methods for:
- Navigation between views
- Component interaction
- Data extraction
- Drag and drop operations
- State validation

#### Test Fixtures (`fixtures/test-fixtures.ts`)

Custom Playwright fixtures providing:
- Configured test environment
- Helper class instances
- Test configuration constants
- Common test utilities

#### Test Data

Predefined test data for:
- Pump models
- Priority levels
- Customer names
- Random data generation

## Best Practices

### Test Design

1. **Atomic Tests**: Each test should be independent and self-contained
2. **Clear Assertions**: Use descriptive assertions that clearly state expectations
3. **Proper Waits**: Use appropriate waits for dynamic content
4. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling for edge cases
5. **Cleanup**: Ensure tests clean up after themselves

### Selectors

1. **Prioritize data-testid**: Use `data-testid` attributes for reliable selectors
2. **Use semantic selectors**: Prefer semantic HTML selectors over CSS classes
3. **Avoid brittle selectors**: Don't rely on implementation details
4. **Consistent naming**: Use consistent naming patterns across tests

### Performance

1. **Parallel execution**: Tests run in parallel by default
2. **Reuse browser state**: Use fixtures to avoid repeated setup
3. **Minimal waits**: Use specific waits instead of fixed timeouts
4. **Efficient selectors**: Use efficient CSS selectors

### Debugging

1. **Use debug mode**: Run tests with `--debug` flag for step-by-step execution
2. **Screenshots**: Tests automatically capture screenshots on failure
3. **Traces**: Use trace viewer for detailed debugging
4. **Console logs**: Check browser console for additional error information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests fail to find elements**
   - Verify the application is running on localhost:3000
   - Check if selectors match current implementation
   - Ensure proper waits are in place

2. **Drag and drop issues**
   - Verify DnD implementation uses proper HTML5 drag events
   - Check if elements have proper draggable attributes
   - Ensure drop zones are properly configured

3. **Timeout errors**
   - Increase timeout values in test configuration
   - Check if application is loading slowly
   - Verify network requests are completing

4. **Browser launch failures**
   - Run `npm run test:e2e:install` to install browsers
   - Check system dependencies
   - Verify permissions for browser installation

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run specific test in debug mode
npx playwright test --debug tests/e2e/scheduling.spec.ts -g "drag and drop"

# Run with visible browser for manual inspection
npx playwright test --headed --project=chromium
```

### Test Reports

After running tests, view detailed reports:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:report
```

Reports include:
- Test results and screenshots
- Video recordings of test runs
- Trace files for detailed debugging
- Performance metrics

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow existing test structure and patterns
2. Use helper classes for common operations
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Add proper assertions and error handling
5. Update documentation as needed

## Configuration

The Playwright configuration (`playwright.config.ts`) includes:

- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
- **Timeouts**: Configurable timeouts for different operations
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry on CI
- **Reporting**: HTML reports with screenshots and traces
- **Web Server**: Automatic dev server startup for tests

Modify configuration as needed for your testing requirements.
